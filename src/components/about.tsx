      <p className="mb-3">
        After finishing Bornova Anadolu Lisesi I decided to study Computer Science at SabancÄ± University.
         I have always been a curious person so I had taught myself the fundamentals of coding years before university
         but I wanted to delve deeper and understand how computers work as well as learn to make my own software.
         During my university years I had the chance to take courses from the best professors in the country deepening my understanding of computers.
         Moreover, I interned at Orion Innovation which helped me convert my theoretical knowledge to practice. Currently, I am trying to improve myself
         in Web Development and I aspire to be a <span className="font-medium">Full Stack Developer</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="italic">When I&apos;m not coding</span>, I enjoy playing
        video games, watching movies, and spending time with my family. I also enjoy reading about
        history and world politics.
